## Instructions

#### Running The Tests

Install all the requirements:

1. Navigate to the project root (you'll find a file called `package.json` there).
2. Install the required packages with the following command:

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

3. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   $ npm test functions
   ```

This command will run the testing file and test your code to make sure it has all the required features.

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.

#### BONUS

1. Go to `debug.js`, you'll find two functions. Both of them don't work.
2. Fix the two functions.
3. To run the bonus tests:

   ```bash
   $ npm test debug
   ```

You'll know when you're done when your code passes all the tests.
